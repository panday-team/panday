2. Use this mapping as a reference for each node
3. Maintain 80-150 line target per checklist node
4. Include inline links in context
5. Add Resources section at end with categorized links
6. Follow frontmatter format from existing nodes
7. Regenerate graph.json after adding new checklist nodes
8. Regenerate embeddings after all content is added
