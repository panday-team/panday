## What Happens During This Period

During Level 2 technical training, apprentices engage in intensive classroom and shop-based learning over several weeks. Students study advanced electrical theory including three-phase systems, motor controls, and complex circuit calculations. Hands-on training covers sophisticated wiring techniques, electrical distribution equipment installation, and specialized electrical systems. Apprentices learn to interpret complex blueprints, apply electrical codes to real-world scenarios, and develop advanced troubleshooting skills. The period includes practical assessments, theoretical exams, and culminates in the Level 2 certification exam that validates intermediate-level competency in electrical construction.
