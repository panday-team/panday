**Communicate with Creditors**:

- Explain temporary apprenticeship training situation
- Request payment deferrals or reduced payments during school
- Many lenders offer hardship programs

**Avoid New Debt**:

- Don't use high-interest credit cards for training costs
- Canada Apprentice Loan is interest-free—use it before credit cards
- Avoid payday loans at all costs (extremely high interest)

### 6. Family and Personal Support

**Discuss with Family**:

- Explain the long-term career benefits (journeyperson wages $70,000-$104,000/year)
- Temporary financial sacrifice leads to permanent financial stability
- Create shared budget and cost-cutting plan

**Childcare Solutions**:

- Ask family members for temporary help during training
