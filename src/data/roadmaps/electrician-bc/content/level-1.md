# Electrician Common Core Level 1

Level 1 is your introduction to formal electrical apprenticeship training in BC. This phase represents the foundation of your electrical education, combining **10 weeks (300 hours) of intensive classroom and shop-based technical training** with approximately **1,000-1,500 work-based hours** under the supervision of a certified journeyperson.

This is the **Common Core** level shared by both Construction and Industrial Electrician pathways—specialization doesn't occur until Level 4, giving you three full years to explore the trade before choosing your specific path.

## Before You Begin

**Work Experience Requirement**:
The industry strongly recommends accumulating **at least 1,000-1,500 work-based hours** before attending Level 1 technical training (typically one year of employment). This hands-on experience ensures you have practical context for the theoretical concepts you'll learn in the classroom.

You can register and begin working immediately after apprenticeship registration—don't wait for technical training to start earning and learning.
