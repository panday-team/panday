# Electrician Common Core Level 1

Level 1 is your introduction to formal electrical apprenticeship training. This phase combines 10 weeks of classroom and shop-based technical training with 1,500 hours of supervised work experience.

## Technical Training

During the 10-week technical training period, you'll learn fundamental electrical concepts, safety procedures, and basic installation techniques in a classroom and shop environment.

## Work-Based Training

After technical training, you'll return to your employer to apply your knowledge in real-world settings, working under the supervision of a certified journeyperson while accumulating required hours.

## Outcome

Upon completing technical training, work hours, and passing the Level 1 exam, you'll advance to Level 2 with increased earning potential and more complex responsibilities.
