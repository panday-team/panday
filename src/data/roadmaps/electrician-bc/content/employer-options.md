## What Happens During This Period

During the sponsorship period, employers establish structured training programs that provide apprentices with progressive skill development over four years. Employers create detailed training plans outlining specific competencies and milestones for each level of apprenticeship. Regular supervision by qualified journeypersons ensures apprentices receive proper guidance and safety training. Employers submit progress reports every 3-6 months documenting work-based training hours and skill achievements. The sponsorship involves ongoing mentorship, performance evaluations, and preparation for technical training periods. Employers maintain records of apprentice progress and ensure compliance with electrical codes and safety standards throughout the apprenticeship term.
