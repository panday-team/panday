## What Happens During This Period

During waiting periods, apprentices typically continue their regular employment with their sponsor, accumulating additional work-based training hours beyond minimum requirements. This time allows for consolidation of recently acquired technical knowledge through practical application. Apprentices may use waiting periods for additional self-study, preparation for upcoming exams, or pursuit of supplementary certifications. Regular communication with apprenticeship advisors helps monitor progress and address any delays. Apprentices maintain their portal access to track application status, submit additional documentation if required, and receive updates on processing timelines. The period often involves preparation for the next phase of training or certification while maintaining active engagement in the trade.
