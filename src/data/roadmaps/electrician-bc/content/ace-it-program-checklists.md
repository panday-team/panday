# High School Enrollment

ACE IT requires active enrollment in a BC high school (typically Grades 11-12). Your school must participate in the Youth Work in Trades program and offer ACE IT opportunities.

---

# Dual Credit System

ACE IT students earn credits toward both:

- **High school graduation** - Course credits for your diploma
- **Apprenticeship Level 1** - Progress toward electrical certification
- Early career exploration and industry connections

# School Support Availability

Not all BC high schools offer ACE IT programs, limiting access for some students.

## The Challenge

- Competition for limited program spots
- School district budget constraints affecting program availability

## Solutions

- Contact your school guidance counselor early (Grade 10) to check availability

- Explore online or hybrid delivery options if available
