# ACE IT Program (Accelerated Credit Enrolment in Industry Training)

ACE IT is a specialized program within BC's Youth Work in Trades system that allows high school students to gain a **massive head start** on their electrical apprenticeship—earning **up to 16 graduation credits plus 480 work-based apprenticeship hours** while receiving wages and completing Grade 12.

This is the ultimate early-entry pathway: you can complete foundation or Level 1 technical training at post-secondary institutions while still in high school, register as an official SkilledTradesBC apprentice, and graduate with both your Dogwood Diploma and significant progress toward Red Seal certification.

## What Is ACE IT?

ACE IT is a model within Youth Work in Trades programs that enables students to:

**Complete Post-Secondary Training While in High School**:
- Attend foundation or Level 1 technical training at BC colleges (BCIT, Camosun, VIU, etc.)
- Training aligns with college intake schedules
- Must register with SkilledTradesBC during Level 1 training

**Earn Dual Credentials Simultaneously**:
- High school graduation credits through WRK courses (WRK 11A, WRK 11B, WRK 12A, WRK 12B)
- SkilledTradesBC apprenticeship credentials
- Foundation program or Level 1 completion certificates

**Receive Financial Support**:
