# Direct Entry

The direct entry path is the traditional route to becoming a certified electrician in BC. It requires **finding an employer sponsor before registration**—the most challenging but fastest route if you have industry connections. Once sponsored, you can register with SkilledTradesBC and begin accumulating work-based training hours immediately while earning wages.

This path is ideal for those who have already secured employment with an electrical contractor, have family connections in the industry, or have completed high school trades programs that provide employer contacts.

## Requirements

Before you can register as a direct-entry apprentice, you must meet these prerequisites:

- **Education**: Grade 12 completion (particularly Math 11/12 and Physics 11 are strongly recommended, though not mandatory)
- **Work Authorization**: Must be legally authorized to work in Canada
- **Physical Requirements**: Good color vision is required for working with color-coded wiring systems
- **Employer Sponsor**: Must have an employer willing to sponsor your apprenticeship and provide on-the-job training

**No registration fee exists**—apprenticeship registration with SkilledTradesBC is completely free.

## Registration Process

Follow these six steps to register as a direct-entry apprentice:

1. **Create Your SkilledTradesBC Portal Account**
   - Visit [SkilledTradesBC Portal](https://portal.skilledtradesbc.ca/Account/Login/Register)
   - Select "I want to register as an apprentice"
   - Complete your profile information

2. **Secure an Employer Sponsor**
   - Individual employers, companies, unions, or non-profits can sponsor apprentices
   - Sponsor must be registered with SkilledTradesBC to provide on-the-job training
   - See "Finding an Employer Sponsor" section below for strategies

3. **Initiate Registration**
   - You can initiate registration through the portal by entering your sponsor's SkilledTradesBC Organization ID
   - Alternatively, your sponsor can initiate registration using your account ID

4. **Sign the Apprenticeship Agreement**
   - Both you and your sponsor must sign the agreement electronically through the portal
   - This agreement outlines training commitments and responsibilities

5. **Wait for Approval**
   - SkilledTradesBC reviews and processes your application
   - Approval typically takes approximately 10 business days

6. **Receive Your Registration Card**
   - Your employer will receive your Registration Card
   - **You must carry this card** as proof of apprentice status for school registration and EI applications
   - Begin accumulating work-based training hours under supervision

## Finding an Employer Sponsor

Finding a sponsor is the most challenging step for many apprentices. Use these strategies to increase your chances:

**Networking and Direct Applications**:
- Apply directly to electrical contractors in your region (don't limit yourself to large firms—small contractors are often more willing to take on apprentices)
- Contact the [Electrical Joint Training Committee (EJTC)](https://www.ejtc.org), a partnership between IBEW Local 213 and the Electrical Contractors Association
- Search [WorkBC's job board](https://www.workbc.ca) for apprenticeship positions
- Attend trade shows and job fairs to meet employers face-to-face
- Ask family and friends in the construction industry for introductions

**Leverage School Programs**:
- Foundation program graduates have a significant advantage—over 70% of VIU foundation graduates secure permanent employment from their work placements
- High school Youth Work in Trades participants often receive job offers from their placement employers
- Program instructors frequently have industry connections and can facilitate introductions

**Understand Employer Incentives**:
Sponsoring apprentices is financially attractive for employers:
- **Tax credits**: $2,000-$4,000 per apprentice annually through federal and provincial programs
- **Return on investment**: Employers typically gain 35-43 cents return per dollar invested in apprentices
- **Skilled workforce development**: Apprentices become trained employees who understand the company's systems and culture

**Union vs. Non-Union Paths**:
- Consider contacting IBEW Local 213 for union apprenticeship opportunities, which include structured placement assistance
- Non-union contractors may offer more flexibility but require you to find and manage your own opportunities

## Initial Costs

Before you begin earning wages, budget for these startup costs:

**Tool Kit**: $1,000-$2,800 depending on quality
- Many apprentices start with a basic starter kit ($400-600) and add tools gradually
- Your employer may offer tool payment plans (e.g., $10/week payroll deduction)
- See the Resources section for detailed tools-by-level breakdown

**Safety Equipment**: $265-740 total
- CSA-approved steel-toe or composite-toe work boots: $150-$300
- Hard hat: $20-$40
- Safety glasses: $20-$50
- Work gloves: $20-$40
- High-visibility vest (may be provided by employer): $15-40
- Hearing protection: $10-30

**Total Initial Investment**: Approximately $1,200-$3,200 before technical training begins.

**Financial Relief**: You can claim up to $1,000 annually through the federal Tradesperson's Tools Deduction on your taxes, offsetting these costs over time.

## What Comes Next

Once registered, you'll:

1. **Begin Work-Based Training**: Accumulate hours working under a certified journeyperson (typically 1,000-1,500 hours before Level 1 technical training)
2. **Attend Level 1 Technical Training**: 10-week full-time classroom training after sufficient hours
3. **Progress Through Four Levels**: Complete 6,000 work hours and 1,200 technical training hours (40 weeks total) over approximately 4-5 years
4. **Specialize at Level 4**: Choose between Construction Electrician or Industrial Electrician streams
5. **Write Red Seal Exam**: Achieve interprovincial certification recognized across Canada
