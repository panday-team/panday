# Direct Entry

If you have secured employer sponsorship and meet the educational requirements, you can enter the apprenticeship program directly without completing the Foundation Program.

## What This Means

Direct entry allows you to start accumulating work-based training hours immediately while working under a certified electrician. You'll begin your journey at Level 1 and progress through the apprenticeship program.

## Benefits

- Start earning while learning
- Gain practical experience from day one
- Build relationship with sponsoring employer
- Skip foundation program if already sponsored
