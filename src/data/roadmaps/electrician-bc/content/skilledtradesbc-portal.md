Apprentices register their apprenticeship agreement and receive confirmation from their sponsor. Users upload required documentation including identification, sponsorship agreements, and qualification certificates. The portal facilitates ongoing progress tracking as sponsors submit work-based training hours every 3-6 months. Apprentices access technical training schedules, book exam sessions, and receive important notifications about program updates and deadlines. The portal serves as a continuous hub for managing the entire apprenticeship lifecycle from registration through certification.
