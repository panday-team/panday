# Electrician Common Core Level 2

Level 2 technical training advances your electrical education with **10 weeks (300 hours) of intensive instruction** focused on single-phase AC systems, commercial and industrial installations, and increasingly complex electrical applications. You'll dive deeper into transformer theory, renewable energy systems, HVAC controls, and advanced motor starters.

This remains part of the **Common Core** curriculum shared by both Construction and Industrial Electrician pathways—specialization still doesn't occur until Level 4.

## Before You Begin

**Work Experience Requirement**:
You'll need approximately **2,300 cumulative hours total** before Level 2 technical training (roughly 1,500 additional hours after completing Level 1), typically requiring another year of full-time employment.

**Prerequisites**:
- Successfully completed Level 1 technical training
- Passed the Level 1 standardized exam (minimum 70%)
- Logged required work-based hours through SkilledTradesBC portal
- Employer sign-off confirming competency development
- Maintained good standing with SkilledTradesBC
