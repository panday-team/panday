# Electrician Foundation

The Foundation Program provides essential knowledge and practical skills to prepare individuals for entry into the electrical construction trade. This 24-week program offers classroom and shop-based training without requiring employer sponsorship.

## What You'll Learn

- Fundamental electrical theory and terminology
- Basic electrical installation and safety procedures
- Industry standards and electrical codes
- Tool usage and safety equipment
- Basic wiring techniques and blueprint reading

## Outcome

Upon completion, you'll receive:

- **Foundation Program certificate**
- **Level 1 technical training credit** - Progress directly to Level 2
- **375 work-based training hours** - Applied toward Level 2 requirements

This means you enter the apprenticeship system at Level 2, bypassing Level 1 entirely and advancing faster toward certification.
