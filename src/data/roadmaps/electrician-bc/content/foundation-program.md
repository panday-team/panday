# Electrician Foundation

Foundation programs provide 24-week pre-apprenticeship training **without requiring an employer sponsor first**, making them the most accessible entry path to the electrical trades. This is the strategic advantage for those who haven't yet secured employment—you can gain comprehensive training, industry credentials, and dramatically improved employability before entering the job market.

**Over 70% of VIU foundation graduates secure permanent employment from their work placements**, demonstrating the power of this pathway. Many employers specifically recruit from foundation program graduates because they've proven their commitment and baseline competency.
